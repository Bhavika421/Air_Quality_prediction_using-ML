# 🌍 Air_Quality_prediction_using-ML

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for analyzing air quality data. The project leverages Python libraries to clean, explore, and visualize air quality metrics, providing insights into environmental conditions.

📄 Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to analyze and understand air quality data using statistical, machine learning, and visualization techniques. This analysis helps identify trends and patterns in air quality metrics, crucial for environmental monitoring and policymaking. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in implementing various machine learning algorithms and successfully predicted air quality levels.
